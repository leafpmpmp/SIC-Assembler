# SIC-Assembler
C++ implementation of SIC Assembler.

Basic assembler functions :                                                                                                     
Translating mnemonic operation codes to their machine language equivalents.                                                     
Assigning machine addresses to symbolic labels.                                                                                 
Write the object program and the assembly listing

Assembler directives :                                                                                                         
Assembler directives are pseudo instructions                                                                                   
They provide instructions to the assembler itself                                                                               
They are not translated into machine operation codes

START : specify name & starting address                                                                                         
END : end of source program, specify the first execution instruction                                                           
BYTE, WORD, RESB, RESW                                                                                                         
End of record : a null char (00)                                                                                               
End of file : a zero-length record                                                                                             

Implementation includes 2 passes :                                                                                             
First pass: Scan the source program for label definitions and assign addresses                                                 
Second pass: Perform actual translation
